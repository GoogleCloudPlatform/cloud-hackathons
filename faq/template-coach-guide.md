# IoT Hack of the Century

## Introduction

Welcome to the coach's guide for the IoT Hack of the Century gHack. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

Remember that this hack includes a optional [lecture presentation](resources/lecture.pdf) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.

> **Note** If you are a gHacks participant, this is the answer guide. Don't cheat yourself by looking at this guide during the hack!

## Coach's Guides

- Challenge 0: Prepare Your Workstation
   - Get yourself ready to develop your IoT solution
- Challenge 1: Hub To Start
   - Create an IoT Hub and run tests to ensure it can ingest telemetry
- Challenge 2: Get To That Edge
   - Make the connection to your Edge device and see that it is properly provisioned.
- Challenge 3: Konnection is Key
   - Connect your device and make sure it can see all other devices in your team.
- Challenge 4: Scale FTW
   - Figure out the scale problem in the world of IoT. How do you hand trillions of data points of telemetry?

## Coach Prerequisites

This hack has pre-reqs that a coach is responsible for understanding and/or setting up BEFORE hosting an event. Please review the [gHacks Hosting Guide](https://ghacks.dev/faq/howto-host-hack.html) for information on how to host a hack event.

The guide covers the common preparation steps a coach needs to do before any gHacks event, including how to properly setup Google Meet and Chat Spaces.

### Student Resources

Before the hack, it is the Coach's responsibility create and make available needed resources including: 
- Files for students
- Lecture presentation
- Terraform scripts for setup

Follow [these instructions](https://ghacks.dev/faq/howto-host-hack.html#making-resources-available) to create the zip files needed and upload them to your gHack's Google Space's Files area. 

Always refer students to the [gHacks website](https://ghacks.dev) for the student guide: [https://ghacks.dev](https://ghacks.dev)

**NOTE:** Students should **NOT** be given a link to the gHacks Github repo before or during a hack. The student guide intentionally does **NOT** have any links to the Coach's guide or the GitHub repo.

### Additional Coach Prerequisites (Optional)

_Please list any additional pre-event setup steps a coach would be required to set up such as, creating or hosting a shared dataset, or preparing external resources._

## Google Cloud Requirements

This hack requires students to have access to Google Cloud project where they can create and consume Google Cloud resources. These requirements should be shared with a stakeholder in the organization that will be providing the Google Cloud project that will be used by the students.

_For example:_

- Google Cloud resources that will be consumed by a student implementing the hack's challenges
- Google Cloud permissions required by a student to complete the hack's challenges.
