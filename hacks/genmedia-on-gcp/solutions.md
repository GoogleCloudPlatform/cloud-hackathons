## Challenge 2: The Visual Blueprint

### Notes & Guidance

Celebrity look alikes, generating descriptions using Gemini. But ideally, generate an image and use Nano-Banana to create the different angles.

## Challenge 3: From Stills to Motion

### Notes & Guidance

TBD

## Challenge 4: The Assembly

### Notes & Guidance

#### Video Editor

In the rest of this gHack's challenges, you will be piecing together your final ad video. Unless you prefer your own editing tools (Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, etc), we strongly recommend using Google Vids.

Google Vids is a web-based video creation app designed to make producing professional videos as simple as creating a slide deck without any prior video editing experience. It is available on any Google Workspace account and also on personal gmail accounts if necessary.

## Challenge 5: Giving It a Voice

### Notes & Guidance

You'll have the choice to use Google's Chirp model or Gemini itself to create the voice-overs. The difference between these two lies in the source of vocal identity and style. Chirp functions as an advanced text-to-speech engine, requiring a pre-existing voice, either from its library or a custom clone, to articulate the provided text with high fidelity; any stylistic nuance is primarily achieved through manipulating the text itself with punctuation and pacing adjustments. In contrast, Gemini operates as a true generative voice model, creating the vocal characteristics and delivery style from scratch based on natural language prompts. This allows a user to conjure a voice by describing it (e.g., "a deep, soothing voice") and directing its emotional tone (e.g., "speak with excitement"), offering a layer of creative control and on-the-fly vocal design that Chirp, in this context, does not.

## Challenge 6: The Soundtrack

### Notes & Guidance

Including instrument information in the prompt can be helpful.
