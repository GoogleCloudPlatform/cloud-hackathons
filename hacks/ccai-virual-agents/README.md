# Intro to CCAI and Virtual Agents

## Introduction

This hack will be an introduction to the world of Contact Center modernization and will teach you how to build a robust chat agent using Google's DialogFlow CX platform.

You will be building a virtual agent for the HR department of a company called PipedPiper. Your agent will be the central place for employees to find authoritative answers  on company policies as well as place to get data from other internal systems (eg. Workday). This agent will demonstrate how a company can increase employee productivity by centralizing access to knowledge - data stored in internal data sets as well as API driven systems - all accessed using natural language from a single chat.

## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will be solving a common problem of standing up a virtual chat agent - useful in many instances to help a companies internal as well as external users. More specifically we will be exploring the foundations for Google's platform called Contact Center AI (CCAI) and the tool for building agents called DialogFlow CX (DF CX).

In this hack you will:

1. Create you first agent 
1. Configure the agent to answer basic questions 
1. Set up a authoritative knowledge set based on which the agent can provide answers
1. Allow the agent to provide GenAI based answers
1. Incorporate an external system API call to answer questions 

## Challenges

- Challenge 1: First agent on the scene
   - Create and initialize a Dialogflow agent
- Challenge 2: What's -YOUR- intent?
   - Set up a basic Q&A steering using Intents and Event handlers 
- Challenge 3: Getting smarter
   - Give Agent access to PDF documents to use in chat answers
- Challenge 4: Time for GenAI 
   - Update our agent flow to include answers based on generator 
- Challenge 5: Agent Phone Home
   - Call external system for knowledge

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of GCP
- Access to a GCP environment

## Challenge 1: First agent on the scene

### Introduction

This challenge is all about setting up and getting our agent configured.

### Description

Create a new agent in the Dialogflow CX Console. Test your agent with a simple "hello" message.

Use the DialogFlow Messenger Integration to create a chat bubble on the provided `page.html` page so that your agent is reachable via a web page.

Host the webage and test it in a browser.

### Success Criteria

- An agent is created in your project
- The agent can respond to an "hello" message
- Dialogflow Messenger agent widget is responding similarly to "hello" messages on a webpage

### Tips

- None :\

## Challenge 2: What's -YOUR- intent?

### Introduction

In this challenge we will train our agent on "Intents" - things we want it to understand from human language.
