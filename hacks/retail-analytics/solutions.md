- Challenge 2: Creating a Dataflow Job using the Datastream to BigQuery Template
   - Now it’s time to create a Dataflow job which will read from GCS and update BigQuery. You will deploy the pre-built Datastream to BigQuery Dataflow streaming template to capture these changes and replicate them into BigQuery.
- Challenge 3: Analyzing Your Data in BigQuery
